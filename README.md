# Weather Comparator App

This project uses React to read in a city from the user, then makes a call to the Google Maps Geocoding API to get the latitude and longitude for that city/location. Then, the latitude and longitude are used to make a call to Open Mateo's public weather API, displaying some data about each city entered.

This project uses React.js, HTML, and CSS


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
